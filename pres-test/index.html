		<p>"You two go with the GMs, stay away from here." Zen In Scary Dream was still calm. "I'll stay with Feng-Ge." Seeing his teammates were about to say something, he added, "No more words, even if I die, I won't take Feng-ge's Halo. I won't affect the general picture."</p>
		<p>During that time, K3, who was around ten meters from them, also recognized something. He didn't want the others to continue their conversation as he walked straight forward.</p>
		<p>Since they were in the world of the Sakura Town, K3's competence couldn't be compared to the time he was fighting in the Kingdom of the Dead Souls. However, the speed and strength he was showing now were still tremendous. It was better than what the two GMs had performed.</p>
		<p>It was out of people's expectations to have someone able to stop him relying on their strength alone.</p>
		<p>Zen In Scary Dream, the one who had spent all the money he had in the game for smoking and drinking, besides the suit vest - the union's uniform, he only had the newbie costume. In the middle of the sparks from the flint, his eyes flared with a cold look that could suffocate people.</p>
		<p>The one who had used the first strike of Rozan Sho Ryu Ha (1), of course, was Feng Bujue, who was standing aside. At this moment, he had activated his [Body-Spirit Congregation Technique], and that was how he could finish his deed before the other could recognize it. Right now, Feng Bujue didn't care about the loss of his Survival Value. Anyhow, he had the halo, so it was impossible for him to die just yet. He was afraid that if he didn't use this skill, with only his character's physique, he couldn't stop the opponent.</p>
		<p>Feng Bujue's plan looked like he wanted to take the Protagonist's Halo, using this invincible status to deploy his research and assessment in the Derivative, also to assist the GMs in doing their tasks. In fact, this plan had another advantage, which was to let the other members of the party leave the scenario and he would contact the Derivative alone. Now that the GMs weren't here, he could try to negotiate. In case the other didn't agree, it wasn't too late to continue fighting. He got the Halo anyway, nothing to be afraid of though.</p>
		<p>Zen In Scary Dream just wanted to collect intelligence. To him, if they could communicate verbally with the Derivative, it would be much better than talking with the fists. Thus, he followed Feng Bujue and said, "Yeah, Mister Derivative… If you agree to stop fighting and—"</p>
		<p>BANG! Feng Bujue's body banged onto a thick pilar, breaking it into two pieces. His Survival Value immediately plunged down to 1% which automatically dissolved his [Body-Spirit Congegration Technique]. Moreover, due to the pillar rupture, the shrine's entrance lost its primary support and started to collapse obliquely onto K3 and Zen In Scary Dream.</p>
